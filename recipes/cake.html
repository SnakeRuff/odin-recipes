    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Every baker needs a solid vanilla cake recipe in their repertoire, and today's recipe is just that.

        It's soft, plush, and perfectly moist. Not to be confused with my white cake, this recipe is a beautiful pale golden color and distinctly vanilla flavored. It pairs beautifully with any frosting, although a traditional chocolate frosting is my favorite finish!</p>
